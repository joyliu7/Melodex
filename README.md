# Music Management Platform

## Brief Project Description ##

The domain of our project is a music management platform. We will build a comprehensive application for our users to listen to songs they like, create customized playlists, search information about artists, as well as seek related merchandise and manage music live events. Our database will focus on artists and their works. This includes artists’ information like names, ages, biographies, record labels as well as their released discographies, including albums and songs. In addition to this, the platform will keep track of the dates, times and venues of artists’ live events and the names and prices of merchandise sold by artists. Information about listeners and playlists they created will also be modeled.

## Database Specifications ##

Our database application has two different types of users: artists and listeners. Each user signed up is uniquely identified with a userID, and users can quickly log in to their account using their email and password.
Listeners can search for an artist, a song or an album by name, accessing their information, such as artist biography, artist discography, song genre and album release date, and they can also create customized playlists according to their interests and needs.
Whether single artists or bands, artists are able to register their information to the application, such as their name, discography and record label, as well as post information about their merchandise and upcoming live events on the platform. 
Therefore, listeners can collect their favorite songs, explore new artists and keep up to date with their favorite ones, while artists can share their discographies and update their recent activities, as well as manage their events and merchandise.
