Components are reusable things we want to use throughout the website, or basically anything that's not a page. For example, if I created a really nice navigation bar, and I want to be able to use this navigation bar in more than one page, we make it in the components folder so everything is organized! eg. Navbar.js

You will notice each file also has a FILENAME.module.css. That's just for styling that specific file if we want to. Again, CSS is NOT required for the project.
